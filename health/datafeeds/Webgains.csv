"Sterimar Nasal Spray 100ml","Sterimar","100% Natural - Pure Sea Water ST","110","100% Natural - Pure Sea Water STÉRIMAR is made from pure sea water, which is collected in St. Malo Bay (France), 15 miles from the coast, at a minimum depth of 5 meters. These waters are monitored by an independent regulatory authority to ensure sanitary standards. It is then: - filtered and sterilised- diluted to 1/3, which makes it isotonic (appropriate for the human body) Sea water has the added benefit of containing various naturally occurring trace elements, many of which have been shown to have antiseptic (silver &amp; zinc), anti-inflammatory (copper) or anti-allergic (manganese) properties. Since it is a natural product, STÉRIMAR is completely safe for use by anyone seeking relief from nasal problems: Safe for babies, children, adults. STÉRIMAR is also free from medical side effects and has no drug interaction. Safe for daily use Safe to use as often as desired Safe to try as a first resort or as an alternative to medication Safe for use with other medications or just before using other medicated sprays  &nbsp; When STÉRIMAR Can Help Hay fever and allergies - washes irritants out of nose Post-operative cleaning - to promote healing and avoid infection Before using medicated nasal sprays - allows medication to be effective, no drug interaction Dry nose - naturally re-moistens nasal tissue Congestion relief - helps to thin mucous and drain sinuses Smoke and pollution - cleans residues out of nose Blocked noses - gentle alternative to nose blowing  &nbsp; Specially Advanced Packaging Micro diffusion technology allows STÉRIMAR to deliver a micro fine spray, which safely and gently cleans nasal passages. Micro fine droplets allow gentle penetration of the nasal passages and allow the solution to disperse evenly Can be used at any angle All of the product is used (100ml dispenses over 300 doses)  &nbsp; Presented in aerosol form and featuring a unique process of microdiffusion, STÉRIMAR® is the gentle solution for decongestant nasal cleansing for all the family.The unique STÉRIMAR® microdiffusion technique consists of a GENTLE FINE SPRAY of sea water onto the nasal mucosa. The droplets of sea water produced by STÉRIMAR® are extremely fine, and so remain in contact with the nasal mucosa for a longer period. This prolonged contact enhances the penetration of the nasal mucosa by the trace elements. Each dose of STÉRIMAR® delivered is aseptic.The anti-reflux valve prevents air from entering the can. The solution thus remains perfectly aseptic after each use. STÉRIMAR® can thus be used safely again and again until it reaches its expiry date, even after multiple uses. Is the propellant gas inside STÉRIMAR® safe?Yes, the propellant gas in the can is harmless. It is nothing more than nitrogen, an inert gas found naturally in the air we breathe. You can use STÉRIMAR® in complete safety. The can is made from recycled aluminium.

Lansinoh works by the process of moist wound healing. Studies reveal moist wound healing offers a soothing environment for sore nipples and as no scab is formed healing is accelerated. Lansinoh coats the raw nerve endings and can provide immediate relief from pain. Other uses:By providing a partially occlusive moisture barrier, Lansinoh lanolin slows down the body's natural evaporation process. This allows the skin to restore its own natural moisture from the inside out. Lansinoh lanolin can be used also to soothe: chapped lips, nappy rash, dry skin on elbows, heels and knees, itchy stretch marks, minor cuts, burns and skin abrasions. Useful for all the family! Directions for use: With clean hands soften a small amount of Lansinoh between fingers and apply to entire nipple area after each feeding or as needed. Lansinoh lanolin does not have to be removed prior to breastfeeding. For your comfort and to help protect sensitive nipples you may also apply Lansinoh before showering. Lansinoh should be used in conjunction with addressing the cause of the soreness. If soreness does not start to ease within 24 hours of commencing use of Lansinoh, or if the problem persists, the user should contact a Lactation Consultant, Breastfeeding Counsellor or their Health Care Professional. Lansinoh lanolin used by itself is not a treatment for sore nipples caused by thrush (Candida albicans) or a bacterial infection. Lansinoh lanolin can be used in conjunction with treatment for skin conditions. Unbroken skin is the best barrier to infection, however Lansinoh relieves dryness that can result in cracking and promotes healthy skin, it may prevent some secondary infections.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Baby+%252526+Maternity/Lansinoh+Lanolin+Cream+56g.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Lansinoh_lanolin_cream_sm.jpg","9.38","Baby & Maternity","Y","43"

With a gusseted bottom for expansion during freezing our Milk Storage Bags are developed specifically for the freezer. The milk you express for your baby is a precious fluid. It combines the best possible nutrition with antibodies, live cells and other substances that protect babies from infection and help them grow and develop. You´ll want to take good care of it and how you store it will affect how well it is preserved. Lansinoh breast milk storage bags are made from food safe polyethylene (PE).

In this way we can prevent any substances which might be harmful for your baby getting into your breast milk. Please take care and handle Lansinoh milk storage bags with care when storing it and reomoving it from your freezer and especially when defrosting. For instance, if a bag is dropped on the floor, or if it is damaged in a different way, it might leak when defrosting. Directions for use:Tear off the safety seal at the top of the bag and open by gently pulling the zipper seal apart. Lansinoh milk storage bags are pre-sterilized and do not need to be washed before use. Pour breast milk into the Lansinoh milk storage bag. Before closing the bag, read the fill quantity by means of the imprinted scale, close the bag and mark the content in the inscription area. Bags can be stored upright or flat in the fridge or freezer. When stored flat, bags are easier to thaw. To avoid freezer burn, the air should be removed from Lansinoh milk storage bags as completely as possible before freezing. For this, take the bag between your forefinger and middle finger (like scissors) and press the air above the liquid level towards the zipper. Seal the bag by compressing the double seal. Repeat the procedure to ensure safe sealing.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Baby+%252526+Maternity/Lansinoh+Milk+Storage+Bags.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Lansinoh_milk_storage_bags_sm.jpg","5.05","Baby & Maternity","Y","45"

It works for approx. 8 days (30 minutes each day) on just two penlight batteries (AA size), so you don't need to recharge it after every treatment. The simple one button operation enables immediate start of the nebulisation. Your medication is always within reach wherever you go whatever you do. The nebuliser also features 2 different modes: continuous nebulisation (the default setting) and manual nebulisation mode. In continuous mode the medication is nebulised until the container is empty. In manual mode you can make the unit nebulise while the button is held and it will stop when you release the button. This mode is useful to synchronise the nebulisation with your inhaling and exhaling breathing cycle which will minimise any medication wastage.As well as being able to nebulise all common medications such as salbutamol and ipratropium, it can be used with high viscosity medications although the nebulisation may be slower. Features:Mesh Technology4 hours nebulisation time on 2 batteriesVirtually noiselessWide medication complianceHandy carrying caseVarious angles for inhalation possible - which makes it ideal for patients laying down in bed or infants being heldSimple one-button operationTwo different nebulisation modes: continuous or manualLow medication residue2 x alkaline AA batteries includedHygienic – easy to cleanCan be used with mouthpiece or maskIncludes Adult & Child Masks, medication container and mesh capBattery-low indicatorCan also be used with NiMH rechargeable batteriesAlso available separately: AC Adapter  Omron U22 MicroAir Demonstration Video - showing how to use and care for the nebuliser","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Nebulisers/Omron+MicroAir+Pocket+Nebuliser+NEU-22.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/omron_microair_neu22uk_sm.jpg","104.34","Nebulisers","Y","70"

The flutter may be the answer...  FOR SUFFERERS OF    Chronic Bronchitis COPD Bronchiectasis   Emphysema   Asthma   Cystic Fibrosis   Now recommended as part of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines on the treatment of non-CF Bronchiectasis FLUTTER offers a unique approach to the common medical problem of clearing excessive mucus from the chest. Air exhaled through the Flutter meets with varying resistance, producing vibration of the airways. These vibrations loosen accumulated mucus, and allow it to move towards larger airways, where it can be expectorated easily without the need for strenuous coughing. Regular sessions with the Flutter of between 5 to 15 minute duration produce a beneficial effect equivalent to that delivered by standard physiotherapy techniques. This convenient palm sized device requires no external power to operate, Flutter works solely by the user exhaling through it. The technique for effective operation is simple and ideally suited to both adults and children.     DO NOT USE THE FLUTTER IF YOU SUFFER FROM THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: Pneumothorax Severe Tuberculosis Coughing Up Of Blood","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Nebulisers/Flutter+Mucus+Clearance+Device.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Flutter_sm.jpg","64.98","Nebulisers","Y","109"

The air in your home may be dirtier than you realise. The fact is that indoor air can be much more polluted than outdoor air, even in the world’s largest and most heavily industrialised cities. Everyone is at risk to some extent, but babies and young children are among the most vulnerable to air pollutants in the home. Using an air purifier in the nursery will go a long way towards protecting your baby and preventing long-term health problems. And using the right air purifiers elsewhere in the house, depending on the size of the rooms and how much they are used, will boost your family’s first line of defence. Vicks has moved beyond the sick room to contribute to the whole family’s well-being. With an air purifier from Vicks, everyone in your family will breathe better and get a good night’s sleep. Improving your respiratory well-being People are becoming increasingly aware of air quality and want to live in a clean home environment. They understand that by breathing better, they—and their family—can live better. This is particularly important for small children, whose immune systems are still developing and can suffer from excessive exposure to air pollutants. Many people, adults included, are unknowingly sensitive to certain air pollutants and will breathe easier and feel healthier in a clean-air environment. Today, one in three people suffers from an allergy, and the number of allergy sufferers dramatically increases with the level of air pollution. Pollutants in the home can include harmful gases and particles such as germs, viruses, dust, bacteria, pollen, mould spores, animal dander, smog, tobacco, smoke and soot. Particles less than 10 microns in size, which may include simple dust, can pass through the nose and throat and go directly into the lungs The Vicks HEPA Air Purifier filters out 97% of impurities with a micron size of 2 or larger. A micron is the unit of measure applied to air bourne particles. The table below shows the average micron size of some of the particles found in the air which may irritate a person. This Vicks Air Purifier will pick up most of these through its HEPA type filter, i.e. Human Hair, Pollen, Pet Dander and some dust dependent on its size.   Particle Micron Size Human Hair 80 to 200 Pollen 10 to 100 Dust 0.5 to 10 Pet Dander 5 to 6 Smoke 0.1 to 1The product works to clean the air as shown in the diagram below. The washable pre filter filters the initial and larger impurities, the Carbon, HEPA and ionizer then work to filter the remaining impurities with up to 97% effectiveness. Ionizers omit ozone and there is conflicting data as to whether this is suitable for asthma sufferers. The Vicks V-9071E has an optional ionizer so this can be utilized at your own discretion. The HEPA and Carbon filters (RPAP-9071/16200) have a life expectancy of approx 6 months dependent on the usage of the product and the quality of the air, replacement filters are readily available. The Air Purifier has an electronic filter change reminder so it is easy to know when a new filter is required. The Vicks V-9071E HEPA Air Purifier is an ideal way to provide cleaner, fresher air to your home. Perfect for people with allergies it could work to provide some relief from symptoms.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Asthma+%252526+Allergy/Air+Purifiers/Vicks+HEPA+Air+Purifier+Ioniser+With+Night+Light+V9071.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/V9071_300dpi_RGB_sm.jpg","59.98","Air Purifiers","Y","117"

PAIN®GONE is a handy, fast working device shaped like a large ballpoint pen and is as easy to use.It has no attachments or batteries and can be used anywhere, anytime. It uses a low-frequency electrical charge produced by crystals to provide prolonged pain relief which is clinically proven to work. PAIN®GONE transmits electrical impulses that activate the nerve pathway. The nerve pathway sends a call for help message to the brain. The brain and the spinal cord speed natural endorphins (the body's own natural painkillers) to stop the pain. The pain is relieved or disappears. What type of pain will PAIN®GONE relieve? PAIN®GONE is effective on any physical pain such as:  back pain  arthritis  tennis elbow  fibromyalgia  sports injuries  post operative pain  skeletal pain  whiplash  travel sickness  nausea  headache  aching muscles  shingles  menstrual pain  lumbago  phantom limb pain  neuralgia  sciatica     Fast, effective drug-free pain relief when you need it Completely natural Safe & simple to use No know side effects No leads, pads or batteries Works over clothing Use for minor, chronic or acute pains  Average operating life: 2 - 3 years Includes carry pouch & multi-language instructions   ","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Pain+Relief+-+TENS/TENS+Pain+Relief+Devices/PainGone+Pain+Relief+Pen.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Paingone_sm.jpg","41.94","TENS Pain Relief Devices","Y","131"

"Virulite Cold Sore Machine","Virulite","Clinical trials have proven benefit in a clinical trial conducted at a North East hospital where topical aciclovir applied five times daily was compared to a single application of the 1072nm light.","331","Clinical trials have proven benefit in a clinical trial conducted at a North East hospital where topical aciclovir applied five times daily was compared to a single application of the 1072nm light. The invisible light treatment halved cold sore healing time as compared to topical aciclovir. It is believed that the 1072NWB light acts as a catalyst, which enhances the local immune response, which allows the body to heal itself more rapidly.. The researchers at Virulite Ltd know that the light has no effect upon the actual virus but does have a positive effect upon the immune cells responsible for fighting the virus. It also plays a role in generating powerful antioxidants within the cells. The Cold Sore Machine is designed to be used on patients aged over 16 years. Q. Is this new treatment a cure or just another treatment?The clinical evidence proves that this is a superior treatment, however ongoing research by Virulite Ltd has given rise to strong anecdotal evidence that if used to treat 4 to 5 separate cold sore attacks, the recurrence of the cold sores is significantly reduced. This is the focus of ongoing research. The Cold Sore Machine is highly effective in 99.5% of individuals.In tests, 86% of patients experienced reduction in healing time of three days. Q. When and how many times can I treat my cold sore?You should treat your cold sore as soon as you become aware of it (blister or tingling stage) and then treat it 12 hours later. In the majority of people this is an adequate treatment, however in a small percentage of people the virus takes a little longer to travel down the nerve to the skin. The 1072NWB light therapy is only effective in the presence of the virus, thus if the cold sore appears to progress after the second treatment it is best to treat four more times a day for 2 days. There is no limit to how many times a cold sore can be treated, but treating more often is not recommended as it is of no proven clinical benefit.It remains effective even after the tingling stage although that is the best time to initiate treatment. Q. What about the site of the cold sore?The invisible light that the Cold Sore Machine uses penetrates the skin relatively easily, thus can treat cold sores in the nose, inside the lip and on the face as effectively as cold sores that are present on the outside of the lips. Q. Does the Cold Sore Machine help relieve pain?In some individuals their cold sores are accompanied by severe pain, our research demonstrated that in the majority of these individuals almost complete pain relief occurs within the period of the 3-minute treatment cycle.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Colds+%252526+Flu/Virulite+Cold+Sore+Machine.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Virulite_Cold_Sore_Machine_sm.jpg","40.00","Colds & Flu","Y","144"

"iTouch Sure Pelvic Floor Stimulator (MamaSure)","TensCare","The new version of the extremely popular MamaSure product Designed to cure incontinence - of the following types: stress,","346","The new version of the extremely popular MamaSure product  Designed to cure incontinence - of the following types: stress, urge and mixed  Can improve sexual intimacy  iTouch Sure has been shown to be clinically safe and effective  Includes vaginal probe  Can be used with men by attaching optional anal probe  Suitable for patients of all ages - not just new mums!     How does it work? By inserting the vaginal probe attached to the control unit, the device sends electronic signals to the probe which stimulates the pelvic floor muscle, helping to strengthen and tone the muscle. This directly gives more control over the bladder, thereby helping cure incontinence.   Who is it suitable for? Women and men of all ages. There is a separate anal probe available from our site which can be used with the iTouch Sure to help men or women with faecal incontinence. It can also help men with post-urination dribble and erectile problems.   Incontinence is especially common after childbirth as the pelvic floor muscle can be weakened. Although the function is often restored to normal within 12 weeks of birth, the iTouch Sure would be useful if there is still some incontinence after this stage.   How long is the treatment? The iTouch Sure should be used for 20 minutes per day for 2 months.   Is there anyone who must not use this device? Pregnant women Women who have a pacemaker fitted This may not be suitable if you have had a prolapse, vaginal infection or recent surgery so check with your doctor before use if in doubt.   Please note that this item is excluded from our standard returns policy for hygiene reasons. This does not affect your statutory rights.   What is included in the package? iTouch Sure control unit Lead Vaginal Electrode (probe) 2 x AA 1.5v batteries Storage pouch Instruction booklet","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Baby+%252526+Maternity/iTouch+Sure+Pelvic+Floor+Stimulator+%28MamaSure%29.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/sure_unit_stress_sm.jpg","59.95","Baby & Maternity","Y","156"

The highly-absorbent core absorbs exudate, while  simultaneously providing a good protective and ventilating wound  cushion. The protective backing on the reverse side of the absorbent  core prevents clothes and bedlinen from being contaminated. As the  backing covers the sides of the dressing, it also prevents side leakage.  DesignMesorb is made of two layers of a  permeable, smooth non-woven which ensures good skin compatibility and  exudate permeability. The soft, thick fluff pulp core combines excellent  absorption capacity with good protective cushioning and the  air-permeable and fluid-repellent non woven backing provides an excellent  exudate barrier.

Design      Mepore is made of an elastic, non-absorbent nonwoven coated with a skin- friendly polyacrylate adhesive.      The absorbent wound pad has a low adherent polyolefin coating to prevent trauma during dressing changes.      The dressing area is protected with a release liner.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/First+Aid+%252526+Dressings/Mepore+Dressings/Mepore+9x25cm+Dressings+%2830%29.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/mepore_sm.jpg","26.94","Mepore Dressings","Y","260"

Clinical studies have shown that there was a significant reduction in allergy symptoms with the group using the Dust Mite Controller. There was also a significant reduction in the use of medicine Dr. G Brivio Dust mites may be the cause of even more allergies than expected:•It is now believed that over exposure to the dust mite may even result in a person becoming allergic to pollen and developing hay fever.•It is also thought that the dust mite might be responsible for up to 50% of respiratory asthma, eczema and rhinitis conditions.The Dust Mite Controller is a non-toxic device, without the use of chemical substances. It is completely ecological and effectively reduces the number of dust mites and the allergens they produce.HOW DOES IT WORK?The Dust Mite Controller simply plugs into your mains socket and emits a complicated range of ultrasonic waves covering up to 62.8 cubic metres. These sounds interfere with the feeding and reproductive cycles of the dust mite, immediately reducing the amount of allergens produced (faecal matter) and over a period cause the population of mites to decrease.•Totally Safe to humans and pets•Scientifically & clinically proven•Reduces risk of asthma and also improves symptoms•Improves quality of lifeWHAT ARE MITES?Mites are microscopical insects the size of 200 microns. In particular, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae (figure 1), living in house dust, they are important agents responsible for allergic disorders.These mites live in house dust and in bed components(like mattresses and pillows), feeding on epithelial dander.  Temperature of 18-21 degrees c and 65% -70% relativehumidity represent the best conditions for their growth.They live between 2-4 months, producing each female 20-50 eggs (figure 2).Allergic disorders due to house dust mites. Mites are the main responsible agents for perennial allergic disorders, such as rhinitis and bronchial asthma.The patients suffering are normally allergic to faecal pellet of mites, that is rich in allergens.After having identified mites as the cause of the allergic disease of the patient, the treatment is mainly based on avoidance of mites and on specific immunotherapy.The elimination of mites (or the reduction of their numbers) is the procedure to follow in any case.Fitted with a UK 3-pin mains plug.  We also stock Dust Mite Controller in a battery powered portable version for smaller areas.

"Itch Gone Portable Insect Mosquito Bite Relief","Tower Health","A unique product suitable for the whole family; safe and effective and very easy-to-use.","555","Itch Gone treats the irritation, itching and swelling from insect bites in secondsItch Gone is a portable medical device that quickly relieves the pain and irritation caused by insect bites. Itch Gone works by stopping histamine release in the affected area; erasing the itch in seconds. Rashes, inflammation, skin redness and blistering fade away much quicker than normal.Itch Gone is ideal for all the family. One application will normally last for 24 hours but you can use it as often as you like.    * Relieves bites in seconds    * Stops irritation and itching    * Reduces swelling    * Safe for use on children    * 100% natural, non allergenic and chemical free    * Compact, ergonomic design    * Provides 1,000+ treatments    * Can be used through light clothingHow to use Itch Gone?Itch Gone is very easy to use and does not need any preparation. Put the tip of the Itch Gone onto the affected area. Then click the button up to 15 times to achieve relief from the mosquito/insect bite and soothe the itching. You feel a small sensation with each click. Repeat treatment as and when required - you cannot overdose. Itch Gone is completely natural and has no side-effects. It does not need batteries and lasts for over one thousand treatments.How does Itch Gone work?Each click sends tiny electrical impulses through the skin into the body. The blood circulation around the affected area increases to neutralise the chemicals and histamine produced by the bite/sting to relieve the itching. The electrical impulses also initiate the production of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers, to soothe the uncomfortable effects of the bite/sting.Do NOT use Itch Gone:- If you have a pacemaker fitted- During the first 16 weeks of pregnancy- near the eyes- Over implanted metal parts- On wet skin or damp surroundings- Close to Oxygen or inflammable liquids- If you suffer from epilepsy- On carotid sinus nerves, laryngeal or pharyngeal muscles in the front and side of your neck- Over the heart- While driving- on children under 8 without adult supervision.

Sensitive Clean: Gentle, yet thorough cleaning for sensitive areas Polish Mode: Polishing and natural whitening of your teeth by removing stains The Professional Care 3000 rechargeable toothbrush has a waterproof handle, is electrically safe and is designed for use in the bathroom. Plug the charging unit into an electrical outlet and place the toothbrush handle on the charging unit. The green charge indicator light flashes while the handle is being charged, and when the handle is fully charged the green charge indicator light shines continuously. The red charge indicator light starts blinking when the rechargeable battery is low.Pressure SensorFor optimal brushing results, Oral-B Professional Care has a pressure control feature to help you brush gently. This helps protect your gums from excessive brushing and makes your toothbrush easy to operate. If too much pressure is applied, the oscillating movement of the brush head will continue but the pulsation will stop. In addition to feeling it, you hear a different sound and a red light glows on the back of the handle.Professional TimerA short stuttering sound at 30-second intervals, which you can hear and feel, reminds you to brush the four quadrants of your mouth equally for a thorough consistent clean. A long stuttering sound indicates when the dentist recommended 2-minute brushing time has been reached.Both timers memorise the elapsed brushing time, even when the handle is briefly switched off during brushing. Only when pausing longer than 30 seconds the timer resets to the initial starting point.In the first days of using the toothbrush, your gums may bleed slightly. In general, bleeding should stop after a few days. Should it persist after two weeks, please consult your dentist or hygienist. If you have sensitive teeth and gums, Oral-B recommends using the sensitive mode.Box Contains1 x Professional Care 3000 rechargeable toothbrush1 x Charging stand2 x Precision Clean brushhead - Surrounds each tooth for a complete clean1 x ProBright brushhead - Rubber polishing cup for naturally whiter teeth1 x Sensitive brushhead - Softer Bristles for sensitive teeth and gumsPLEASE NOTE THE PLUG ON THE CHARGER IS A TWO PIN PLUG SUITABLE FOR A BATHROOM ENVIRONMENT","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Dental+Hygiene/Rotary+Toothbrushes/Braun+Oral-B+Professional+Care+3000+3+Mode+Electric+Toothbrush.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Braun-Professional-3000-mode3_sm.jpg","74.95","Rotary Toothbrushes","Y","272"

"Dry Night Trainer Bed-Wetting Enuresis Alarm For Children","TensCare","Simple, effective and easy-to-use","586","Easily attached to wristUser friendly, light and worn as a watchSupplied with alternative watch facesReplaceable lithium coin battery includedProven safety standardBedwetting Your child is certainly not the only one! A child’s toilet training develops during the first years of life when children start to become aware of the urge to urinate. The child must still learn to hold their urine at night or wake up to the sensation of a full bladder. When a child still wets their bed beyond pre-school age and there is no medical reason to justify this, the child suffers from bedwetting.Training using a bedwetting alarmA bedwetting alarm teaches the child to wake up to the sensation of a full bladder. The alarm immediately sounds an alarm tone when the child loses a few drops of urine. The alarm will then be switched off and the child can finish urinating on the toilet. Through this therapy, the child learns to associate the sensation of a full bladder with having to wake up.How will this proceed?In time the child will wake up on its own without having to depend on the alarm tone. When the child remains dry for fourteen nights in a row, the bedwetting alarm is not needed anymore. Even when the bedwetting alarm has not been used and the child still manages to keep dry, the training is considered successful and the child is toilet trained.The Dry Night Trainer Especially user friendly, lightweight and as compact as a watch. It can be worn on either the left or right wrist and the child’s own underwear can be used during this training.How does the Dry Night Trainer work?The bedwetting alarm is attached to the child’s wrist. The alarms cable is then clicked into the child’s underwear on the spot where the urine will reach the cloth first. When the cloth between two sensors becomes wet, they will react and cause the bedwetting alarm to sound off an alarm tone, waking up the child.Childs motivationIt is important that the user of the alarm (the child) is motivated to conjure up the discipline needed to work with this method. You can increase the child’s motivation by going at this training in a playful manner and using the supplied covers for the alarm. These come in the shape of a football, a star, and a flower.Safety The Dry Night Trainer is an advanced device that makes use of miniature electronics. The currents being used in the sensors to measure the humidity are extremely low and therefore absolutely safe. It also adheres to all required medical standards.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Therapy/Dry+Night+Trainer+Bed-Wetting+Enuresis+Alarm+For+Children.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Dry_Night_Trainer_Black_Strap2 _sm.jpg","31.92","Therapy","Y","280"

True, but there are things that we can do as parents and caregivers to make children—and ourselves—feel better. Using a humidifier is one of them. One of the first things doctors recommend when a child comes down with a cold is to use a humidifier, as this can help loosen congestion and soothe a sore throat. Proper humidification is especially important for children since their smaller nostrils get bunged up more easily.More generally, the regular use of a humidifier can help keep you and your family healthy. Maintaining the right amount of moisture in your home improves the ability of your respiratory system to expel germs from the body. Proper humidity levels in the home can also ease other types of discomfort caused by dry winter air, such as a dry nose and throat, itchy skin, and dry eyes.The Vicks Mini Ultrasonic Humidifier is small, compact and suitable for use from birth- ideal for a child's bedroom (or even an office desk!). Set and forget- the humidifier can run up to 8 hours at the highest setting (mist output is adjustable) before refill of tank is necessary. If desired a Vicks Scent pad can be used - one is included free.There are optional cartridges available to buy separately. The Demineralisation cartridge can help reduce white dust if you live in a hard water area. The Anti-Bacterial cartridge acts with a germ killing function on possible water-bred germs.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Asthma+%252526+Allergy/Humidifiers/Vicks+Paediatric+Cool+Mist+Ultrasonic+Humidifier+VH5000.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/VH5000E_FrontLeft_300dpi_RGB_sm.jpg","60.00","Humidifiers","Y","297"

"Tenease Tennis Elbow Pain Relief","Other","Clinically proven","708","With over one million sufferers in the UK every year, tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a common condition that will affect most adults at some stage in their lives. Until now there has been no truly effective way of providing pain relief and promoting recovery for this condition. Over seven years in development and research, Tenease uses patented vibration therapy to block pain and reduce the healing time for tennis elbow sufferers.Tennis elbow is a chronic condition caused by damage to the fibres that make up the tendon. The latest research has shown that the condition is caused not by inflammation but by a lack of it which gives the characteristic pain in the elbow and weakness. Tenease provides pain relief and works to increase the blood flow to the area allowing the damaged tendon to heal.Tenease is the only medical device available that is specifically developed for tennis elbow and golfers elbow (medial epicondylitis). The device is safe, suitable for home use, cost effective and easy to use. Press the button and you'll receive 10 minutes of treatment to help you manage your elbow pain. Doctors recommend at least three treatments a day.Operates from 2 x AA alkaline batteries (included).","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Pain+Relief+-+TENS/TENS+Pain+Relief+Devices/Tenease+Tennis+Elbow+Pain+Relief.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Tenease_Tennis_Elbow_Pain_Relief_sm.jpg","49.99","TENS Pain Relief Devices","N","371"

"Medinose Anti-Allergy Device","Medisana","Helps with hay fever and other allergies - no side effects!","718","Helps with:  Hay fever  House dust-mite allergy  Pet & Animal-hair allergies  **Drug-free treatment....No side-effects** How it works: Medinose is a completely new approach to treating allergies. It uses photo therapy to practically eliminate allergic symptoms such as:  Itchiness & congestion in the nose and sneezing  Headaches  Red, itchy and watering eyes  Inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes  Large quantities of watery mucous  Changes in the voice  Restricted sense of taste and smell - all within a couple of weeks of use. Using photo therapy, Medinose inhibits the release of histamine, relieving or even completely eliminating allergic reactions and complaints in a natural way. The body is not burdened by drugs and Medinose has no side effects. Medinose consists of a small power pack and two probes (diodes) which are inserted into the nostrils.  Each treatment session with the Medinose takes just approx. 4.5 minutes 2-3 times a day, after which the unit switches off automatically. The Medinose can be used anywhere: at home, on the move or at work. With severe symptoms, treatment can be repeated several times without any side effects. As soon as the symptoms subside, the number of treatments can be reduced. The Medinose is, however, also suitable for prevention.  Photo therapy is a method developed in hospitals for treating allergic reactions. It uses visible red light that acts on the cellular metabolism, slowing down the immune reaction and reducing inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes. The light causes an overall reduction in allergic reactions and symptoms. The manufacturers of Medinose have taken this technology and developed a hand held, consumer friendly device.  A double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of Medinose. Following treatment, 72% of allergic rhinitis patients reported a reduction in symptoms and an improvement in their overall condition, compared to only 24% in the placebo group. Patients also received a nasendoscopy (examination of nasal tissue using an endoscope), which further supports the results by showing a significant reduction in nasal tissue inflammation after treatment.  Frequently asked questions:   Can children use the Medinose too?There are absolutely no side effects so the Medinose can also be used by children. For reasons of hygiene, you can also purchase additional interchangeable applicators.  How do I clean the nasal applicators?Clean them carefully using a tissue.  How soon will I notice the effects of treatment?Some relief may be noticeable after just a few treatments, but you should certainly experience a clear improvement within 2 to 3 weeks.  I don't have any problems with my nose, my allergy only causes a swelling of the eyes and an irritable cough. Can Medinose also help with these?Swelling of the eyes and other allergic symptoms arise due to the release of the substance histamine from the mast cells in the nasal mucous membranes. Photo therapy with the Medinose works via the nasal mucous membranes. However, using red light therapy, it isn't only nose complaints that disappear, but also the oppressive feeling associated with allergies, watering or swollen eyes, coughing itches and headaches.  Can the Medinose also help with my allergy to cats?The Medinose helps with allergies of the nasal mucous membranes i.e. not just hay fever, but also animal hair and house dust allergies.  I take tablets/medication for my allergy. Do I have to keep using the medication?The Medinose has no effect on the effectiveness of medication. In theory, the Medinose and medication can be used side by side, but it has been established that allergy symptoms subside, so less medication is needed.      Includes: 1x 9v battery Battery change indicator 3 year manufacturer warranty","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Asthma+%252526+Allergy/Allergy/Medinose+Anti-Allergy+Device.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/medinose_sm.jpg","69.98","Allergy","Y","381"

These include surgical wounds, cuts and grazes. How Mepore works      The porous structure of the nonwoven fabric ensures air and water vapour permeability.      The fabric is stretchable, conforms well to body contours and allows body movements when in place.      The fabric is non-absorbent and provides a barrier for blood and fluid strike-through.      The polyacrylate adhesive has been designed to be gentle to the skin but at the same time provide secure fixation.      The wound pad can absorb moderate amounts of wound fluids and the low-adherent surface reduces the risk of adherence to the wound.      The easy-to-remove protection foil permits sterile application, as well as simplifying dressing application. Design      Mepore is made of an elastic, non-absorbent non-woven coated with a skin-friendly polyacrylate adhesive.      The absorbent wound pad has a low adherent polyolefin coating to prevent trauma during dressing changes.      The dressing area is protected with a release liner.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/First+Aid+%252526+Dressings/Mepore+Dressings/Mepore+11x15cm+Dressings+%2840%29.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/mepore_sm.jpg","24.96","Mepore Dressings","Y","383"

Proper humidification is especially important for children since their smaller nostrils get bunged up more easily.More generally, the regular use of a humidifier can help keep you and your family healthy. Maintaining the right amount of moisture in your home improves the ability of your respiratory system to expel germs from the body. Proper humidity levels in the home can also ease other types of discomfort caused by dry winter air, such as a dry nose and throat, itchy skin, and dry eyes.The Vicks Germ Free Humidifier has a special patented germ-killing UV light chamber which kills up to 99.9% of bacteria, mold and fungi in water. Set and forget this humidifier which runs up to 24 hours on one filling (on low setting). Perfect for every day use in your home as low energy consumption keeps your electricity bill down and quiet operation makes this suitable to leave running overnight, or during the day while you are at work. Great for every day use as no mist is produced as the evaporative technology works invisbly in your home.How do evaporative Humidifiers work?Evaporative Humidifiers are equipped with a special filter, also known as a wicking filter, which soaks up water. A fan draws dry air through the moistened filter and re-circulates humidified air back into the room. During this process the air is simultaneously washed, i.e. various dust and other air borne particles are retained to a certain extent in the wicking filter. You should change the filter under normal circumstances every 2 months. It is called an AntiMicrobial Filter for Vicks Evaporative and GermFree Humidifiers (ACA-3E), available on our website.Evaporative Humidifiers automatically provide the right humidity level. This is known as the 'self regulating principle'. Due to laws of physics the air will only accept the amount of moisture it is able to hold at a particular temperature. There is no visible mist expelled from an Evaporative Humidifier and this is normal.If desired a Vicks Scent pad can be used with the humidifier - one is included free. For peace of mind there is also 2 years warranty on this humidifier.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Asthma+%252526+Allergy/Humidifiers/Vicks+Paediatric+Evaporative+GermFree+Humidifier+VH3900.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/VH3900_Unit_sm.jpg","79.99","Humidifiers","Y","406"

"Allevyn Adhesive Dressings 10cm x 10cm (x10) 66000599","Smith & Nephew","Low-allergy adhesive dressings for comfort and healing","801","Allevyn Adhesive provides the advantages of Allevyn hydrocellular dressings in a self-adhesive format for simple and effective fixation. Features          Low allergy adhesive    Tapered construction with micro-thin edges    Unique trilaminate structure    Perforated wound contact layer    Highly absorbent central hydrocellular layer    Waterproof and bacteria-proof outer film layer    Full range of sizes Benefits      Convenient adhesive presentationThe wound contact layer of Allevyn Adhesive is coated with a low allergy adhesive which is designed to adhere well to intact skin, but not to wounds.  The adhesive has a proven low risk of skin irritation.Highly absorbentIn-vitro studies and clinical experience both demonstrate that as healing progresses Allevyn Adhesive dressings can stay in place for up to seven days.  This capacity results from a combination of properties:    The perforated wound contact layer allows even viscous exudate to pass into the dressing.    The hydrocellular core of the dressing absorbs and holds liquid in its microscopic structure.    The breathable outer surface of the dressing allows excess moisture to evaporate away from the dressing.The result is the formation of a wound environment, which allows healing to progress without the need for frequent dressing changes.Promotes early healingAllevyn Adhesive allows the formation and maintenance of a moist wound healing environment at the wound surface, preventing eschar formation and promoting rapid and trouble-free healing.Profiled dressing edgesAllevyn Adhesive has a profiled cross-section, narrowing to micro-thin edges which ensure the dressing remains securely in place and reduces the risk of accidental removal by shear between the dressing and clothes or bedding.Bacteria-proof/WaterproofThe outer polyurethane layer of Allevyn Adhesive prevents strike-through of excess exudate from the dressing, and minimises the chances of cross-contamination and wound infection, therefore enhancing patient comfort and reducing healthcare costs.  It also allows the amount of fluid in the dressing to be monitored.Cushioned ComfortAllevyn Adhesive dressings are soft and cushioning, giving excellent patient comfort and protection. Indications      Wound Management by secondary intention on chronic and acute, full thickness or partial thickness or shallow granulating, exuding wounds such as pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, infected wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, malignant wounds, surgical wounds, first and second degree burns, donor sites and fungating ulcers.  Contraindications / Precautions Do not use any Allevyn product with oxidising agents such as hypochlorite solutions (eg Eusol) or hydrogen peroxide, as these can break down the absorbent polyurethane component of the dressings.In common with all adhesive products, some cases of irritation and/or maceration of the skin surrounding the wound have been reported. It should be noted that inappropriate use or too frequent dressing changes, particularly in patients with fragile skin, can result in skin stripping.If reddening or sensitisation occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.  Code        Size      66000043      7.5cm x 7.5cm 66000599      10cm x 10cm66000045      17.5cm x 17.5cm66000044      12.5cm x 12.5cm66000046      22.5cm x 22.5cm66150043      7.5cm x 7.5cm66150044      12.5cm x 12.5cm66150045      17.5cm x 17.5cm66150046      22.5cm x 22.5cm66000744      12.5cm x 22.5cm   ","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/First+Aid+%252526+Dressings/Allevyn+Dressings/Allevyn+Adhesive+Dressings+10cm+x+10cm+%28x10%29+66000599.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Allevyn_Adhesive_10cmx10cm_2_sm.jpg","38.52","Allevyn Dressings","Y","449"

"Allevyn Adhesive Dressings 7.5cm x 7.5cm (x10) 66150043","Smith & Nephew","Low-allergy adhesive dressings for comfort and healing","855","Allevyn Adhesive provides the advantages of Allevyn hydrocellular dressings in a self-adhesive format for simple and effective fixation. Features: Low allergy adhesiveTapered construction with micro-thin edgesPerforated wound contact layerUnique trilaminate structureHighly absorbent central hydrocellular layerWaterproof and bacteria-proof outer film layerFull range of sizes Benefits:Convenient adhesive presentationThe wound contact layer of Allevyn Adhesive is coated with a low allergy adhesive which is designed to adhere well to intact skin, but not to wounds.  The adhesive has a proven low risk of skin irritation.Highly absorbentIn-vitro studies and clinical experience both demonstrate that as healing progresses Allevyn Adhesive dressings can stay in place for up to seven days.  This capacity results from a combination of properties:    The perforated wound contact layer allows even viscous exudate to pass into the dressing.    The hydrocellular core of the dressing absorbs and holds liquid in its microscopic structure.    The breathable outer surface of the dressing allows excess moisture to evaporate away from the dressing.The result is the formation of a wound environment, which allows healing to progress without the need for frequent dressing changes.Promotes early healingAllevyn Adhesive allows the formation and maintenance of a moist wound healing environment at the wound surface, preventing eschar formation and promoting rapid and trouble-free healing.Profiled dressing edgesAllevyn Adhesive has a profiled cross-section, narrowing to micro-thin edges which ensure the dressing remains securely in place and reduces the risk of accidental removal by shear between the dressing and clothes or bedding.Bacteria-proof/WaterproofThe outer polyurethane layer of Allevyn Adhesive prevents strike-through of excess exudate from the dressing, and minimises the chances of cross-contamination and wound infection, therefore enhancing patient comfort and reducing healthcare costs.  It also allows the amount of fluid in the dressing to be monitored.Cushioned ComfortAllevyn Adhesive dressings are soft and cushioning, giving excellent patient comfort and protection. Indications      Wound Management by secondary intention on chronic and acute, full thickness or partial thickness or shallow granulating, exuding wounds such as pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, infected wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, malignant wounds, surgical wounds, first and second degree burns, donor sites and fungating ulcers.  Contraindications / Precautions Do not use any Allevyn product with oxidising agents such as hypochlorite solutions (eg Eusol) or hydrogen peroxide, as these can break down the absorbent polyurethane component of the dressings.In common with all adhesive products, some cases of irritation and/or maceration of the skin surrounding the wound have been reported. It should be noted that inappropriate use or too frequent dressing changes, particularly in patients with fragile skin, can result in skin stripping.If reddening or sensitisation occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.  Code        Size      66000043      7.5cm x 7.5cm 66000599      10cm x 10cm66000045      17.5cm x 17.5cm66000044      12.5cm x 12.5cm66000046      22.5cm x 22.5cm66150043      7.5cm x 7.5cm66150044      12.5cm x 12.5cm66150045      17.5cm x 17.5cm66150046      22.5cm x 22.5cm66000744      12.5cm x 22.5cm   ","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/First+Aid+%252526+Dressings/Allevyn+Dressings/Allevyn+Adhesive+Dressings+7.5cm+x+7.5cm+%28x10%29+66150043.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Allevyn_Adhesive_10cmx10cm_2_sm.jpg","26.28","Allevyn Dressings","Y","492"

"Prima Home Test Cholesterol Tester","Prima","Easy-to-use home test - answer in 3 minutes","874","HOME CHOLESTEROL TEST  Check the concentration of cholesterol in blood to verify abnormally high levels.  INDICATED FOR Adults with a healthy lifestyle.  WHY SHOULD I PERFORM THE TEST?  Cholesterol is produced by the liver and absorbed from food. It contributes to forming cellular membranes, neurons and hormones. The normal level of cholesterol should be lower than 200 mg/dl; in case of higher levels the risk of heart attack and arteriosclerosis (furring of the arteries) is increased. High cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for developing heart disease and having a heart attack. It is important to find out what your levels are because lowering high cholesterol reduces your risk of heart attack. Checking the level of cholesterol in the blood is a very good tool for verifying our own health status and eventually taking the required preventive actions.  HOW DOES IT WORK?  The Test uses an enzymatic method and gives a quantitative result of the level of cholesterol in blood. 1) The sample is a drop of blood taken with the painless sterile lancet contained in the box. 2) Obtain a big drop of blood by squeezing the finger. 3) Put the drop of blood on the indicated point on the card. 4) Wait for 3 minutes and read the result on the corresponding coloured position.

"Prima Home Test Prostate Tester","Prima","For home use - results in 10 minutes","875","PROSTATE - PSA TEST  Check the level of the Prostate Specific Antigen – PSA – in blood to verify a prostatic physiological alteration.  INDICATED FOR: Men from 45 to 75 years old.   WHY SHOULD I PERFORM THE TEST? The PSA level in blood gives an indication of the physiological condition of the prostate. Values above the norm may show a hypertrophy of the prostate. Size variation could be benign – due to a soft inflammation, for example – but it could also have malignant causes.  Checking the normality of the PSA value is a very good tool for verifying prostate health status and eventually taking the required preventive actions. In case of cancer, early detection and prevention can be life saving. Please note: the test is not designed to take the place of having a PSA reading done via your health professional if you are already undergoing treatment.   HOW DOES IT WORK?  The test is based on an immunochromatographic reaction correlated to the reference laboratory test (EIA). The cut-off is calibrated at 4 ng/ml according to the international standard. 1) The sample is a blood drop taken with the painless sterile lancet contained in the box. 2) Obtain a big drop of blood by squeezing the finger. 3) Put the drop of blood on the indicated point on the device. 4) Add the diluent, wait for 10 minutes and read the result.

"Beurer Limited Edition Cosy HK Heating Pad","Beurer","","886","With the Beurer Cosy Heating Pad you can gently warm and relax any part of the body. Snuggle up to the extra-soft microfibre fleece heating pad for a pleasant, cosy well-being. The heating pad features an electric temperature control that regulates precisely the warmth supply according to the chosen setting (0-1-2-3). The heating pad is made of fluffy microfibre fleece. The easy care material and the detachable operating element make the blanket machine washable up to 30 degrees centrigrade. The fastest way to heat up the heating pad is to first set the switch to the highest setting. A lower setting can be selected later if required. After switching on the heating pad, the setting starts flashing briefly, while the heating pad conducts a self-test. Then the setting remains illuminated continuously. It is recommended to use the lowest temperature setting for extended use of the heating pad. 0 = off, 1 = Minimum heat, 2 = Medium heat, 3 = Maximum heat.   The Beurer Cosy Heating Pad only uses 100 watts whilst operating and so is an econimical way of heating the part of body you wish to heat. The heating pad has an automatic switch-off which stops the heat supply approx. 90 minutes after switching on the pad. The illuminated function display then starts to flash. To operate the heating pad again, you must first set the switch to zero. After about 5 seconds it can be turned on again. There is also a safety system which prevents the heating pad from overheating.    Features: Size approx. 44 x 33 cms  BSS Overheat Protection  Electronic temperature control  Rapid heat up  Machine washable","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Therapy/Beurer+Limited+Edition+Cosy+HK+Heating+Pad.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/beurer-hk-limited-edition-2011_sm.jpg","36.00","Therapy","Y","521"

"Excilor Fungal Nail Infection Pen Treatment Pack","Other","Pen Applicator. Effectively treats fungal nail infection","890","Clinically proven efficacy Complete nail penetration to treat fungal nail infection Can be applied in seconds One complete course of treatment Dries in one minute No need to file the nail Results visible when the nail starts to grow back Applicator pen system Very easy and convenient to use Designed to treat the whole of the nail Used to coat the entire surface of the damaged nail {Studies have shown that on average, a single applicator constitutes a full course of treatment for one infected nail}   Instructions: Before each application, clean the nail and remove any traces of nail polish. Use the pen-shaped applicator to coat the whole nail and the underside of the nail rim with the product. Apply generously twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). For best results, treat the infected area for a minimum of three months. It is best to continue the course of treatment until the nail has recovered completely. Allow the nail to dry (1 to 2 minutes) before putting on socks and/or shoes. (After each application, you can use your usual nail polish or lacquer, but don’t forget to remove the nail polish before the next treatment). Make sure the applicator is fully closed after each treatment to prevent evaporation. Use a nail clipper to trim the nail as soon as new growth appears. The applicator contains sufficient product for 400 applications.          Precautions: For external use only. Avoid all contact with eyes and mucous membranes. If the product comes into contact with eyes or mucous membranes, rinse with plenty of water. Keep out of the reach of children and animals. Make sure the applicator is fully closed after each treatment to prevent evaporation. If there is no visible improvement in the nail as it grows back (after about one month of treatment), consult your GP, but remember that you may need to treat for over 3 months.     Ingredients: Ethyllactate, aqua (water) (7%), acetic acid, penetration enhancer, film-forming agent, preservatives (contains no parabens).","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Skincare/Excilor+Fungal+Nail+Infection+Pen+Treatment+Pack.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Excilor_Applicator_Pen_Treatment_Pack_sm.jpg","18.10","Skincare","Y","525"

"Babyfoot Original Deep Skin Exfoliation for Soft, Smooth Feet","Other","Say Goodbye to dry, cracked feet!","942","Exfoliate & remove dry, rough, cracked skin on feet Treats athlete's foot and unpleasant foot odour Easy and safe to use Contains 17 natural plant extracts Removes a full layer of skin, for ‘total foot’ skin health No scrub, no abrasion. Just apply, wait 2 hours and wash off For men and women of all ages Fits shoe sizes women (4-12) and men (4-11) Contains 2 sock packs (each containing 35ml of product)     Even if you exfoliate skin regularly, dry skin on feet can be a problem. Other foot care products or professional skin care products fall short of perfect skin, peeling skin on feet only in parts. BabyFoot is an all natural skin care product that promotes 'total foot' skin peeling (exfoliation) for all skin types. This skin treatment removes not just dry skin patches, but also helps alleviate bad foot odour.  Baby Foot contains 17 types of natural extracts with a high moisturizing power. Baby Foot contains healthy, safe natural extracts like Orange, Lemon and Grapefruit citrus oils, Calendula, Clematis leaf and Chamomile.  Whilst the results can look dramatic, Baby Foot is very, very safe - the whole process is totally painless.  1) Cure dry,cracked, rough skin on feet Most normal foot care products target dry skin patches, leaving some old and some new layers of skin exposed. With these aggressive methods skin is torn away, damaging new layers of skin that also dry out rapidly too. Baby Foot is natural, safe and gentle yet far more effective, as the new skin exposed is sealed and undamaged. The entire hard skin layer is removed kindly to leave baby soft feet you may not have had in years!  2) Cure Bad Foot Odour When different layers of skin are exposed, bacteria can get in between the layers and grow there, resulting in nasty food odour. With Baby Foot, the newly exposed skin is sealed and perfect, preventing bacteria growth and eliminates a major cause of foot odour   How does it work? The cells of the skin are held together with desmosomes, which include various fats and proteins held between the cells. Under normal conditions the desmosomes should be decomposed by skin enzymes and the dead skin peels off gradually.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Skincare/Babyfoot+Original+Deep+Skin+Exfoliation+for+Soft%2C+Smooth+Feet.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/BabyFoot_Packaging_sm.jpg","17.94","Skincare","Y","575"
"Prima Home Test Thyroid TSH Tester","Prima","Quick and easy home testing","943","The TSH level in blood gives an indication of the physiological condition of the thyroid. TSH, which is secreted by the pituitary gland, regulates and controls the activity of the thyroid gland. Therefore, a raised TSH level indicates an under active thyroid and this is the principle on which the Thyroid Test is based for the detection of the condition hypothyroidism (symptoms may include feeling tired, depressed or cold regularly, weight gain, dry skin, brittle hair, enduring constipation or menstrual cycle irregularities in women). Checking the normality of the TSH value is a very good tool for verifying thyroid health status and eventually taking the required preventive actions. In case of cancer, early detection and prevention can be life saving.  Check the level of the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone – TSH – in blood to verify a thyroid physiological alteration. The TSH screening should be performed yearly by women from 35 to 64 years-old with healthy lifestyle.   HOW DOES IT WORK?  The test is based on an immunochromatographic reaction correlated to the reference laboratory test. The cut-off is calibrated at 5 &#956;IU/mL according to the international standard.

INDICATED FOR Men and women from 45 to 75 years-old   WHY SHOULD I PERFORM THE TEST? Gastrointestinal disorders often bleed. The blood can be detected specifically by the faeces test. The presence of blood can be justified by benign causes; for example, ulcers, hemorrhoids, polyps, or fissures. It could also be due to a malignant pathology such as colorectal cancer.  Checking the presence of blood in the faeces is a very good tool for verifying health status and eventually taking the required preventive actions. In case of cancer, early detection and prevention can be life saving.  HOW DOES IT WORK?  The test is based on a new generation immunological methodology with high sensitivity which doesn’t require any dietary restrictions before or during the test. 1) Collect the samples using the special collection paper which allows you to do it with comfort and hygiene. 2) Use the stick of the collection tube and collect the sample three times in three different days. 3) The sample is closed inside the tube. 4) Add the diluent, wait for 10 minutes and read the result.

The antibodies against Helicobacter pylori are usually absent in people who have never contracted that infection.  INDICATED FOR: All of us.  WHY SHOULD I PERFORM THE TEST? The bacterium Helicobacter pylori grows in the gastric mucosa, where it can damage it to the point of causing stomach ulcers. The associated disturbances are gastritis and burning sensation in the stomach, even if more than 50% of the infections are without symptoms. This infection can be treated easily with specific antibiotics (which are prescribed by your doctor).  Checking the presence of antibodies against Helicobacter pylori is a very good tool for verifying our own health status and eventually taking the required preventive actions. In fact, an untreated infection can increase the probability of developing stomach cancer.  HOW DOES IT WORK?  The test works by using an immunology reaction that verifies the presence of specific antibodies against Helicobacter pylori. 1) The sample is a blood drop taken with the painless sterile lancet contained in the box. 2) Obtain a big drop of blood by squeezing the finger. 3) Put the drop of blood on the indicated point on the device. 4) Add the diluent, wait for 10 minutes and read the result.

"Prima Home Test Allergy Tester","Prima","Suitable for ages over 15 years","946","Individuals with allergic sensitivity to various substances such as pollens, animal hairs, feathers or some foods, have abnormally high levels of IgE (Immunoglobulin E) antibodies. That sensitivity can be developed in different moments of life, but can affect children, adolescents, and adults.  With this allergy test, you can assess IgE levels in the blood and detect any allergy sensitivity. The test should be performed in the case of symptoms that can be associated with the allergy, such as rashes and redness on the skin, tears or repetitive sneezing when in the presence of dust or in contact with animals (dog, cat, etc), or the appearance of oedema (swelling) after ingesting particular food. The test can be performed at any time, but not in subjects younger than 15 years, as the test sensitivity was adjusted on an adult population. CE Certified by Notified Body n°0483.  The main symptoms of allergy are redness on the skin, rash, tears, repetitive sneezing and swelling. These symptoms can be mixed up with the usual signs of viral and bacterial infections such as flu, cold and a bacterial sore throat. That is why it is important to check if the IgE level is abnormally high in these cases or in subjects who have a family history of allergy. Through determining an immunoglobulin E level higher than average, the doctor can direct to a more specific search for substances causing allergic symptoms and can define a therapy adapted to the patient.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Diagnostic+Equipment/Prima+Home+Test+Allergy+Tester.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/pack_Allergy_home_test_sm.jpg","13.80","Diagnostic Equipment","Y","579"

"Prima Home Test Iron Anaemia Test FERRITIN Tester","Prima","Results in 10 minutes","955","Check the level of Ferritin – FER – in blood to verify the iron stores.  INDICATED FOR The FER screening should be performed by all the pregnant women and regularly by all anaemic people with healthy lifestyle.  WHY SHOULD I PERFORM THE TEST? The Ferritin level in blood is useful in detecting iron store depletion as the concentration drops to very low values. As iron deficiency develops, iron stores are depleted before anaemia becomes apparent.  Checking the normality of the FER value is a very good tool for verifying the iron deficiency anaemia and eventually taking the required preventive actions.  HOW DOES IT WORK? The test is based on an immunochromatographic reaction correlated to the reference laboratory test. The cut-off is calibrated at 20 ng/mL according to the international standard. 1) The sample is a blood drop taken with the painless sterile lancet contained in the box. 2) Obtain a big drop of blood by squeezing the finger. 3) Put the drop of blood on the indicated point on the device. 4) Add the diluent, wait for 10 minutes and read the result.

"Prima Home Test Albumin Protein KIDNEY Tester","Prima","Home test - results in 5 minutes","956","KIDNEY ALBUMIN TEST  Check the concentration of albumin in the urine to verify alterations in kidney function.  INDICATED FOR All of us.  WHY SHOULD I PERFORM THE TEST? A high albumin level reflects dysfunction of the kidneys’ filtering function. The kidneys filter blood to remove impurities: small composites are discharged while proteins, which are bigger, are retained by kidneys. Albumin is one of those proteins that should be retained by kidneys. If the kidneys work properly, the concentration of albumin is zero or less than 10 mg/dl. Concentration of glucose or triglycerides, diabetes or hypertension are factors that promote the concentration of albumin in urine.  Checking the presence of albumin in the urine is a very good tool for verifying our own health status and eventually take the required preventive actions.  HOW DOES IT WORK? The Test works by pointing out the concentration of albumin in the urine as normal or above the normal value. 1) The sample is the first urine of the day collected in a clean cup contained in the box. 2) Take the strip-test from the grip side. 3) Dip the strip-test for few seconds. 4) Wait for 5 minutes and read the result.

"Noppy Bed-Wetting Enuresis Alarm","Other","It really works!","957","Bedwetting Your child is certainly not the only one! A child's toilet training develops during the first years of life when children start to become aware of the urge to urinate. The child must still learn to hold up their urine at night or waking up to the sensation of a full bladder. When a child still wets their bed beyond the age of pre-school and there is no medical reason to justify this, the child suffers from bedwetting.  Training using a bedwetting alarm A bedwetting alarm teaches the child to wake up to the sensation of a full bladder. The alarm immediately sounds an alarm tone when the child loses a few drops of urine. The alarm will then be switched off and the child can finish urinating on the toilet. Through this therapy, the child learns to associate the sensation of a full bladder with having to wake up.  How will this proceed? In time the child will wake up on its own without having to depend on the alarm tone. When the child remains dry for fourteen nights in a row, the bedwetting alarm is not needed anymore. Even when the bedwetting alarm has not been used and the child still manages to keep dry, the training is considered successful and the child is toilet trained.  The Noppy bedwetting alarm Especially user friendly, lightweight and just as compact as a watch. It can be worn on either the left or right wrist and the child's own underwear can be used during this training.  How does the Noppy bedwetting alarm work? The bedwetting alarm is attached to the child's wrist. The alarm's cable is then clicked into the child's underwear on the spot where the urine will reach the cloth first. When the cloth between two sensors becomes wet, they will react and cause the bedwetting alarm to sound off an alarm tone, waking up the child.  Child's motivation It is important that the user of the alarm (the child) is motivated to conjure up the discipline needed to work with this method. You can increase the child's motivation by training in a playful manner - using the supplied covers for the alarm. These come in the shape of a bear, a butterfly and a ladybug.  Safety The Noppy bedwetting alarm is an advanced device that makes use of miniature electronics. The currents being used in the sensors to measure the humidity are extremely low and therefore absolutely safe. The Noppy also adheres to all needed medical standards.   Technical information Power supply  : 3V battery type CR1632 Especially user friendly, lightweight and compact.  Can be worn on either the left or right wrist.  No extra costs for special underwear; you can use the child’s own underwear.  Quality The Noppy is manufactured in Ireland to high quality standards, and the unit is designed to withstand wear and tear. The manufacturers have many years of experience in the healthcare sector and the Noppy has been refined to result in a quality device that works!

During its development SimplyGo was rigorously tested and subjected to extreme conditions including impacts, vibrations and extreme temperatures to deliver reliable performance day in and day out.Easy to take with youMeasuring 11.5 inches wide x 6 inches deep x 10 inches high (29.2 x 15.2 x 25.4 Cm).Complete with battery it weighs just 10 pounds (4.5 Kg).Supplied complete with custom designed trolley with oversized wheels for maximum manoeuvrability.Simple to useWith its Touch Screen interface SimplyGo is really simple to use.Three Modes of OperationContinuous FlowIn Continuous Flow mode SimplyGo will provide a continuous supply of oxygen from 0.5 to 2.0 lpm in 0.5 lpm increments. SimplyGo is therefore compatible with all CPAP type devices and at last we have a POC suitable for patients of all ages from infants upwards.    0.5 LPM    1.0LPM    1.5 LPM    2 LPMPulse modeWhen operating in Pulse mode, SimplyGo detects when the patient begins to take a breath and then immediately delivers a measured pulse of oxygen (bolus), determined by the setting number (ranging from 12ml to 72ml), during inhalation.Unique Sleep Mode - Guarantees Continuity of Oxygen SupplySleep mode is similar to Pulse mode, delivering a measured pulse of oxygen when the patient begins to take a breath. However in Sleep Mode it has increased trigger sensitivity and a softer pulse for maximum comfort.Uniquely, unlike other pulse dose POC, if no breath is detected for just 15 seconds the system will automatically begin delivering 2 lpm of continuous flow.It will continue delivering 2 lpm for 2 minutes before reverting back to breath detection mode.If it, again, does not detect a breath for 15 seconds it will continue to deliver 2 lpm for another 2 minutes.This pattern will repeat indefinitely or until breathing is detected. The unit will not shut down for breathing inactivity in Sleep Mode.Included in package:SimplyGo portable oxygen concentratorCarrying caseMobile cartOne rechargeable Lithium Ion batteryDC and AC power cordsAccessory bagUser manualNasal CannulaTechnical Data:Size : 11.5 in x 10 in x 6 in (29.2 cm x 25.4 cm x 15.2 cm)Weight : 10lbs (4.5kg) with battery installedUser interface Push buttons: back-lit liquid crystal display (LCD)Filtration Internal: air inlet filter (gross particle), main-flow bacteria filterACInput: 100 to 240 VAC, 50/60 Hz, 2.0 AOutput: 19 VDC 7.9 A maxPower consumption: 150W while charging, 120W while not chargingDCInput: 12 to 19 VDC 8.0 A maxBatteryLithium Ion 14.4 VDC (nominal)Dimensions: 0.9 x 7.4 x 4.6 (2.7 cm x 18.8 cm x 11.7 cm)Weight: 1.5 lbs (0.7 kg)Charge time: Approximately 2 to 3 hours per battery from fully dischargedBattery durationNumber of Batteries    Pulse Dose Setting of 2**    Continuous flow 1 LPM    Continuous flow 2 LPM1            3.5 hours            2.3 hours        0.7 hours2            7 hours                4.6 hours        1.4 hours3            10.5 hours            6.9 hours        2.1 hours4            14 hours            9.2 hours        2.8 hours","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Oxygen+Concentrators/Philips+Respironics+SimplyGo+Portable+Oxygen+Concentrator.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/SimplyGo_72dpi_RGB_sm.jpg","3960.00","Oxygen Concentrators","Y","607"

These include surgical wounds, cuts and grazes.  How Mepore works The porous structure of the nonwoven fabric ensures air and water vapour permeability. The fabric is stretchable, conforms well to body contours and allows body movements when in place. The fabric is non-absorbent and provides a barrier for blood and fluid strike-through. The polyacrylate adhesive has been designed to be gentle to the skin but at the same time provide secure fixation. The wound pad can absorb moderate amounts of wound fluids and the low-adherent surface reduces the risk of adherence to the wound. The easy-to-remove protection foil permits sterile application, as well as simplifying dressing application.  Design Mepore is made of an elastic, non-absorbent nonwoven coated with a skin- friendly polyacrylate adhesive. The absorbent wound pad has a low adherent polyolefin coating to prevent trauma during dressing changes. The dressing area is protected with a release liner.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/First+Aid+%252526+Dressings/Mepore+Dressings/Mepore+9x30cm+Dressings+%2830%29.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/mepore_sm.jpg","29.99","Mepore Dressings","Y","614"

Features          Low allergy adhesive    Tapered construction with micro-thin edges    Unique trilaminate structure    Perforated wound contact layer    Highly absorbent central hydrocellular layer    Waterproof and bacteria-proof outer film layer    Full range of sizes Benefits      Convenient adhesive presentationThe wound contact layer of Allevyn Adhesive is coated with a low allergy adhesive which is designed to adhere well to intact skin, but not to wounds.  The adhesive has a proven low risk of skin irritation.Highly absorbentIn-vitro studies and clinical experience both demonstrate that as healing progresses Allevyn Adhesive dressings can stay in place for up to seven days.  This capacity results from a combination of properties:    The perforated wound contact layer allows even viscous exudate to pass into the dressing.    The hydrocellular core of the dressing absorbs and holds liquid in its microscopic structure.    The breathable outer surface of the dressing allows excess moisture to evaporate away from the dressing.The result is the formation of a wound environment, which allows healing to progress without the need for frequent dressing changes.Promotes early healingAllevyn Adhesive allows the formation and maintenance of a moist wound healing environment at the wound surface, preventing eschar formation and promoting rapid and trouble-free healing.Profiled dressing edgesAllevyn Adhesive has a profiled cross-section, narrowing to micro-thin edges which ensure the dressing remains securely in place and reduces the risk of accidental removal by shear between the dressing and clothes or bedding.Bacteria-proof/WaterproofThe outer polyurethane layer of Allevyn Adhesive prevents strike-through of excess exudate from the dressing, and minimises the chances of cross-contamination and wound infection, therefore enhancing patient comfort and reducing healthcare costs.  It also allows the amount of fluid in the dressing to be monitored.Cushioned ComfortAllevyn Adhesive dressings are soft and cushioning, giving excellent patient comfort and protection. Indications      Wound Management by secondary intention on chronic and acute, full thickness or partial thickness or shallow granulating, exuding wounds such as pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, infected wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, malignant wounds, surgical wounds, first and second degree burns, donor sites and fungating ulcers.  Contraindications / Precautions Do not use any Allevyn product with oxidising agents such as hypochlorite solutions (eg Eusol) or hydrogen peroxide, as these can break down the absorbent polyurethane component of the dressings.In common with all adhesive products, some cases of irritation and/or maceration of the skin surrounding the wound have been reported. It should be noted that inappropriate use or too frequent dressing changes, particularly in patients with fragile skin, can result in skin stripping.If reddening or sensitisation occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

Studies have shown that maintaining humidity level within this range can reduce the survival of flu viruses on surfaces and in the air. This can help you and your children to feel more comfortable.

"Allevyn PLUS Adhesive Dressings 12.5cm x 12.5cm (x10) 66000805","Smith & Nephew","","1043","ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive hydrocellular dressings have a unique trilaminate structure made up from a wound contact layer, a soft and highly absorbent central hydrocellular layer, and an outer film layer, which is both bacteriaproof and waterproof. ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive dressings employ all the proven benefits of moist wound healing, without any breakdown of the dressing caused by contact with exudates. The result is effective exudate management of these wounds, which have traditionally proved difficult to care for.  Features  Low allergy adhesive Tapered construction with micro-thin edges Unique trilaminate structure Absorbs 65% more exudate than ALLEVYN Adhesive Perforated wound contact layer Highly absorbent central hydrocellular layer Waterproof outer film layer       Benefits The wound contact layer of ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive is coated with a low allergy adhesive which is designed to adhere well to intact skin, but not to wounds. The adhesive is non-irritating. In-vitro studies and clinical experience demonstrate that ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive dressings can stay in place for up to seven days.  ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive creates and maintains a moist wound healing environment at the wound surface Easy to Use ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive dressings absorb exudates and cellular debris, ensuring minimal mess at dressing changes. Dressing changes are therefore easier for the caregiver and less traumatic for the patient. The dressing can be cut to dress wounds in awkward places. ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive has a profiled cross-section, narrowing to micro-thin edges which helps ensure the dressing remains securely in place and prevents accidental removal by friction between the dressing and clothes and bedding. Waterproof/Aids in the Prevention of Bacterial Contamination The outer polyurethane layer of ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive prevents strikethrough of excess exudates from the dressing, and minimizes the chances of cross-contamination and wound infection, therefore enhancing patient comfort. It also allows the amount of fluid in the dressing to be monitored, as progression of exudates can be seen through the pink top film. ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive dressings are soft and cushioning, giving excellent patient comfort and protection, contributing to a pressure reduction protocol.   Indications  ALLEVYN Plus Adhesive is indicated for high to extra high levels of exudate absorption and the management of chronic, acute, full, or partial thickness, or shallow granulating, exuding wounds. Some typical wounds are ulcers (venous, arterial, diabetic), pressure sores, donor sites, surgical incisions, surgical excisions and burns (1st and 2nd degree). Can be used in conjunction with INTRASITE Gel for necrotic or sloughy wounds. Creation and maintenance of a moist wound environment. Moist wound environments have been established as optimal environments for the management of the wound. Provides physical separation between the wound and external environments to assist in preventing bacterial contamination of the wound.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/First+Aid+%252526+Dressings/Allevyn+Dressings/Allevyn+PLUS+Adhesive+Dressings+12.5cm+x+12.5cm+%28x10%29+66000805.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Allevyn_PLUS_Adhesive_12-5cmx12-5cm_sm.jpg","59.58","Allevyn Dressings","Y","673"

"Circulation Pro - Boosts Blood Professional Circulation Massager","Medi-Direct","Inc gel, remote control and pads/cables","1069","What is Circulation Pro?  Circulation Pro is a unique Calf Pump System and Electro foot plate Stimulator developed to help stimulate and boost the Blood Circulation in the Legs, Feet & Ankles.  It’s the only Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) medical device that promotes the full walking motion; the most important movement is the heel rise motion that stimulates the Calf Muscle Pump (CMP) therefore helping to stimulate blood flow. This motion is vital for the optimisation of the CMP’s function, the heel rise motion contracts the CMP which squeezes the veins and starts to push the venous blood back to the heart.  Pack Includes: Remote control with battery Conductive Gel (85g) 2 x Pairs Electrode Pads 2 x Connecting Cables 1 x Power Adaptor 1 x User Manual  How to use Circulation Pro:  Circulation Pro can be used in the comfort of your own home, just sit back, relax and put your feet on foot peddles Use the wireless remote control to adjust the settings and to control the level of intensity required for each treatment session Can be plugged into a socket or use x4 C batteries, carry on your treatment when you need it most.  Circulation Pro has 15 therapeutic modes which automatically cycle through your treatment, every minute the mode will change.   How is Circulation Pro different to other circulation booster devices?  The main difference are the independent foot pedals, these ensure you can start gently and effectively improving your circulation through calf pump exercise within minutes of using the Circulation Pro.  Just using the calf pump foot rocking pedals alone for 10 minutes a day can stimulate an increase in your blood flow. If you combine the EMS stimulation from the electrical conductive foot plates with the foot pedal rocking you will certainly go a long way to start improving circulation, reduce swelling in the ankles and feet as well as having that feeling of healthier and more energised legs.  We recommend that you seek medical guidance before using Circulation Pro if you have the following conditions: Pregnancy Heart disease or cardiac dysfunction High fever/Infectious disease Malignant tumour Epilepsy Abnormal blood pressure Skin problems or skin sensory disorders  When not to use Circulation Pro - if you have: cardiac pacemaker Implanted defibrillator Any other implanted metallic or electronic device Electronic life support equipment Electronic medical devices attached to the body, e.g. electrocardiograph Existing Deep Vein Thrombosis (“DVT”), to avoid any possibility of mobilising the clot.","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Footcare/Circulation+Pro+-+Boosts+Blood+Professional+Circulation+Massager.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Circulation_Pro_sm.jpg","149.99","Footcare","Y","698"

When the temperature rises, this can be easily spotted in the ear. The ear is therefore an excellent place to measure temperature.  Unlike other ear thermometers, the Braun Thermoscan features a pre-warmed tip which minimises the cooling effect that could result from introducing a cool probe tip into the ear.  Features: Clinically tested, number 1 ear thermometer with large front panel display to see temperature while measuring Proven to be more accurate than rectal or temple measurement Patented ExactTemp feedback system confirms in seconds that the thermometer is in the correct position and an accurate temperature reading has been taken Last-reading memory recalls the previous temperature reading in degrees C or degrees F Fast, accurate and safe for newborns and the whole family Ultra soft and gentle tip is warmed up to 34°C for professional accuracy and extra comfort Uses disposable lens filter caps (replace for each reading to maintain accuracy and hygiene) Includes 21 lens caps and protective cap Operates on 2 x 1.5v AA LR6 alkaline batteries (included)","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Thermometers/Braun+Thermoscan+5+Ear+Thermometer+IRT6020.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Braun-Thermoscan-IRT6020_sm.jpg","40.99","Thermometers","Y","725"
"Braun No Touch AND Forehead Thermometer NTF3000","Braun","Accurate - Dual technology - Colour temp display","1097","The ultra-sensitive sensor and special optical system captures twice as much radiated heat compared to traditional forehead thermometers without an optical system, to ensure accuracy and more consistent readings which you get in just two seconds.  The large back-lit LCD display with colour coding makes it easier to read, so interpreting temperature is easy. It helps you understand the readings and act accordingly - green (normal temperature), yellow (elevated temperature) and red (high temperature).  Touch Mode and No-Touch Mode  You can take your child's temperature by holding the thermometer in front of your child’s forehead up to 5cm away. The thermometer doesn’t touch the forehead at all, therefore reducing stress for your child. The temperature can then be taken without any risk of waking them if they’re asleep. The no-sound mode can also be used so that your child’s temperature can be taken almost silently.  Why use the forehead to take a temperature?  Using the forehead to take a temperature is a gentler way to monitor a fever than other methods, and it’s clinically proven to be as accurate and reliable as any other. It’s also extremely hygienic, as there is no contact with the forehead which helps to stop contamination passing from one family member to another. However, if you need further reassurance when your child is awake for instance, the thermometer can be used in Touch mode and placed directly onto the forehead.   Features: Unique dual no-touch and touch technology Clinically proven Braun accuracy Large colour coded display Clear back-lit display Easy access to all functions No touch mode ideal for when your child is sleeping The only forehead thermometer that uses a patented, clinically proven breakthrough technology Proximity sensor to help you find the right distance for measurement (up to 5 cm) Backlight enables reading in the darkness and no sound mode in order not to wake up the child Stylish silver blue design Fast 2 second reading Hygienic to use Uses 2 x AA Alkaline batteries (included) Includes protective cap","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/Thermometers/Braun+No+Touch+AND+Forehead+Thermometer+NTF3000.html","http://www.healthcare4all.co.uk/images/Braun-No-Touch-Forehead-Thermometer-NTF3000_sm.jpg","49.99","Thermometers","Y","726"

"Betavivo Crispy Oat Heart Cereal (x15 sachets)","Other","Shown to reduce cholesterol and blood sugar","1103","What is the effect on cholesterol?   Oat beta-glucan has been shown to reduce blood cholesterol. High cholesterol is a risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease. One serving of Betavivo gives 3 g beta-glucan from oats, which is the daily amount required to reduce cholesterol.  1. Eat one serving of Betavivo. 2. When Betavivo reaches the stomach the beta-glucan fibres dissolve and form a gel. 3. The gel formed by Betavivo ties up gallic acids which are carried out of the body the natural way. When the liver produces new gallic acid it uses cholesterol from the blood system.  As a consequence, LDL – and total cholesterol levels are lowered by 10-15% (while HDL remains unaffected).    What is the effect on blood sugar? Consumption of oat beta-glucan as part of a meal contributes to the reduction of the blood glucose rise after the meal. 1. Eat one serving Betavivo with a regular meal. 2. When Betavivo reaches the stomach the beta-glucan fibres dissolve and form a gel. 3. The gel acts as a viscous barrier leading to a slower uptake of carbohydrates.  As a consequence, blood sugar and insulin response is reduced after the meal.   How do I eat Betavivo?  Betavivo are crispy oat hearts with a mild oat flavour. Each single-serving sachet contains the daily amount of beta-glucan needed for the positive health effects. One serving gives a good feeling of satiety. Eat Betavivo with yoghurt or milk for breakfast or as a snack during the day. Top up as preferred with fruits, berries or nuts. Have a big glass of water after eating Betavivo.

"Revitive iX Circulation Booster with IsoRocker","Other","Latest model - design award winner - medically proven","1112","Revive your day with REVITIVE  Everyone at some point has suffered leg pain and discomfort. For many this may just be an inconvenience. For others, tired, aching, swollen legs may severely impact their quality of life and prevent them from leading an active lifestyle.  REVITIVE Circulation Booster is a new medical device designed to alleviate the discomfort in the legs caused by poor circulation and improve overall leg health. Poor leg circulation When your leg muscles are inactive for long periods while standing or sitting, the blood flow in the leg veins slow significantly and consequently blood and fluid begin to pool. This pooling creates pressure in the leg veins, causing the feeling of tired, aching and heavy legs. Poor leg health circulation is not only due to a sedentary lifestyle. Underlying medical conditions, lifestyle factors and age can damage the leg veins and arteries to impair circulation.  Signs of poor circulation may include: •Tired, aching or heavy-feeling legs •Swollen feet and ankles (sometimes referred to as oedema) •Cramping sensation in the buttocks, legs or feet •The feeling of pins and needles or numbness in the legs or feet •Your legs, feet, hands or arms feel cool and the skin may become discoloured  Who is at risk of developing poor circulation? There are certain factors that may increase your chances of developing poor circulation, including: •Being aged 50 or over •Certain conditions or illnesses may increase your chances of developing poor circulation. These could include Diabetes, Arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and high blood pressure •If you are immobile, for example wheelchair users, or if you are house or bed bound •If your family has a history of vascular disease, heart attack or strokes •Smoking or obesity •If you sit or stand for long periods at work or at home or have a generally sedentary or inactive lifestyle  A healthy lifestyle may help reduce your susceptibility to poor circulation. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can all help maintain healthy circulation.  How does REVITIVE Circulation Booster work? REVITIVE Circulation Booster activates your circulation pump by applying proven Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) to the soles of your feet through two large foot pads. This EMS makes the foot and calf muscles contract and relax to create a pumping action. Immediately, blood is actively pushed back up your legs, providing fast acting relief from aches, pains and swelling associated with poor circulation. REVITIVE IX is a Class IIa medical device, scientifically tested by independent clinical trials at King's College London and South Bank University. It uses electrical muscle stimulation technology, which is drug free, to help stimulate blood circulation. Who might use Revitive IX? If you are otherwise healthy, but: &#9632; Sit for long periods at your desk. &#9632; Are less active than you used to be. &#9632; Have a sedentary or inactive lifestyle. &#9632; Your work requires you to sit or stand for long periods then you may want to consider using REVITIVE IX to see if it could help improve blood circulation. After consultation with your GP, REVITIVE IX may also help if you experience aches and swelling in your legs.  The REVITIVE IX: &#9632; Can help increase circulation in the lower legs & feet &#9632; Can help reduce swelling in the calves and feet. &#9632; Can help alleviate minor aches in otherwise healthy people.  REVITIVE Circulation Booster has been designed to easily fit into people' lifestyles. Not only is it a drug free device, it is also easy to use, employing a remote control and one touch controls. It is lightweight and portable, making it easy to store- for example, it should fit under a sofa when not in use.  IsoRocker The IsoRocker allows the REVITIVE IX to gently ‘rock’ back and forth creating involuntary ankle movement to replicate heel toe raises.  WidePulse waveforms WidePulse waveforms are our latest breakthrough in circulation technology which results in a more comfortable feeling stimulation   Pack Contains: Revitive IX Device with IsoRocker and integrated handle Remote Control with 2 x AA batteries 4 x TENS Electrode Pads and Dust Pad protectors AC/DC Mains Adaptor Instructions for Use   Hazards and Cautions  Revitive is suitable for use by most healthy people.
